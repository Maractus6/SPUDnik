what is finished about the game so far, what still
needs to be added, any bugs you have found, and, for our sake, how to play the game
in its current state (and see anything you want us to see)

*H1* What's done so far
state machine completed
potato growth cycle is implemented (the fully grown version has dark green on it)
player is moving and animating

*H1* What's got to be added
water function
health system
another map with research (skill tree)
parallax movement
sound
no win or lose game yet
no passage of time function
player animating for plant watering
collecting the potatoes (potato counter)
the 2nd bg for game state: the color palette is too jarring right now and you can't see the seeds

*h1* how to play right now
press select to flip thr states
arrow keys to move player
button b sows the potato seeds
button a waters the plants: you want to water the plants every cycle or they wont grow
